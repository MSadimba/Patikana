# Patikana
A wonderful project on enhancing the security measures of institutions i.e. schools through the use of computer vision.

## Abstract

In an era where automation is paramount, security systems must evolve. Current security equipment, including Closed-Circuit Televisions (CCTVs), scanners, padlocks, and various detectors (such as infrared occupancy, smoke, and carbon monoxide detectors), typically respond to agents without incorporating visual recognition.

**Patikana** is a model designed to enhance security by detecting items entering or leaving a building through computer vision technology. It will be trained specifically on items that should remain within a designated area, such as computers in a laboratory. By labeling these devices, Patikana will restrict unauthorized movement of items out of the building.

The aim of this study was to improve the security of valuable items within an institution, focusing on the student population at Riara University, which served as the pilot site for this initiative.
